# 3D-no-martices
Basic 3D Graphics without matrices

**Look mum no matrices!**

Comments:

- made from scratch
- no matrix needed! :-)
- needs optimization
- it is not a 3D engine!
- have a look a the 4D cube (Tesseract) rotating in the background

Technical commments:

- Perlin noise 
    for a random smoth movement of each shape.
- world, local space
    every shape has a local 3D-space and each of these space are a child of the global space
    (wold space) or of another local space.
